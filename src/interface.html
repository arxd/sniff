<h2>About</h2>
<p>There are a lot of resources out there to help kids and students and adults learn how to program.  This is yet another one.</p>
<p>The concept is that playing games is fun.  But instead of playing games 'directly', you write a program to play the game for you.</p>
<p>The games are simple and open ended.  Beginners can enjoy the immideate visual feedback of their commands, while even advanced programmers can find some harder challenges.</p>
<p>The programming language used here is designed to be as simple as possible, yet expressive enough to keep even advanced programmers entertained.</p>

<h2>For Educators (Parents/Teachers/Older Siblings)</h2>
<p>The best way to learn something is to teach it.
	So find a student and start helping them learn to program.</p>
<p>While there are tutorials here for self-motivated students, 
	these games are also designed for young students, who may not be able to read yet.</p>
<p>With the help of a teacher, the concepts can be grasped by even young students.</p>
