<h2>About</h2>

<p>There are a lot of resources out there to help kids and students and adults learn how to program.  This is yet another one.  It is currently a work in progress and <em>very</em> rough around the edges.</p>

<p>The idea behind Sniff was to create a keyboard-based programming environment for kids (and adult kids).  It has a keyboard-based interface in contrast to the mouse-based interface of Scratch.  The keyboard requires fewer motor skill than the mouse/touchpad, and serves as a pragmatic introduction to the keyboard.</p>

<p>We all love playing games.  Here, instead of playing games 'directly', you write a program to play the game for you.  The games are simple and open ended.  Beginners can enjoy the immideate visual feedback of their commands, while even advanced programmers can find some harder challenges.  The programming language used here is designed to be as simple as possible, yet expressive enough to keep even advanced programmers entertained.</p>

<h2>For Educators (Parents/Teachers/Older Siblings)</h2>
<p>The best way to learn something is to teach it.
	So find a student and start helping them learn to program.</p>
<p>While there are tutorials here for self-motivated students, 
	these games are also designed for young students, who may not be able to read yet.</p>
<p>With the help of a teacher, the concepts can be grasped by even young students.</p>
